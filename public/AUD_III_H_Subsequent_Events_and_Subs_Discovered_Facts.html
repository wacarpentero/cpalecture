        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Distinguish <strong>subsequent events</strong> (between the financial statement date and the auditor’s report date) from <strong>subsequently discovered facts</strong> (after the auditor’s report date).</li>
          <li>Identify <strong>Type I (adjusting)</strong> vs <strong>Type II (non‑adjusting)</strong> events and their reporting implications.</li>
          <li>Perform required <strong>procedures through the report date</strong> and determine when to <strong>dual‑date</strong> or <strong>change the report date</strong>.</li>
          <li>Respond appropriately when facts are discovered <strong>after report release</strong>, including communication with management and <strong>those charged with governance (TCWG)</strong>.</li>

    <h2>1) Definitions & Date Framework</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subsequent events:</strong> events occurring <em>after</em> the financial statement date but <em>on or before</em> the auditor’s report date.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsequently discovered facts:</strong> facts discovered <em>after</em> the auditor’s report date that may have affected the report if known earlier.</li>
        <li><strong>Report release date:</strong> the date the auditor permits the report to be used (often distribution/public filing).</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Lock these dates in your planning memo and update as they change to keep procedures aligned.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>2) Type I vs Type II Subsequent Events</h2>
    <section class="grid two">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Type I — Adjusting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide additional evidence about <strong>conditions that existed</strong> at the balance‑sheet date.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> Adjust the financial statements.</li>
          <li><em>Examples:</em> settlement of litigation confirming the amount owed; subsequent receipts confirming accounts receivable collectibility; bankruptcy of a major customer due to pre‑existing financial difficulties.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Type II — Non‑adjusting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Relate to <strong>conditions arising after</strong> the balance‑sheet date.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> Disclose the nature and estimated financial effect (or a statement that such estimate cannot be made).</li>
          <li><em>Examples:</em> major business combination or disposal; casualty losses; issuance of debt or equity; significant restructuring announced after year‑end.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>

    <h2>3) Required Procedures Through the Report Date</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>Read board and committee minutes through the report date and inquire about matters discussed at meetings for which minutes are not yet available.</li>
        <li>Inquire management and, where appropriate, those charged with governance (TCWG) about subsequent events and subsequent transactions.</li>
        <li>Scan the post‑year‑end general ledger (GL) for significant or unusual transactions.</li>
        <li>Obtain updated <strong>written representations</strong> dated as of the report date addressing subsequent events and disclosures.</li>
        <li>Perform targeted procedures where risks are identified (for example, subsequent cash receipts for valuation, loan covenant compliance after year‑end).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>4) Facts Arising After Report Date but Before Release</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss the matter with management and TCWG and determine whether the financial statements need <strong>adjustment or disclosure</strong>.</li>
        <li>Perform necessary procedures related to the new information.</li>
        <li><strong>Dating choices:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dual‑date</strong> the report: keep the original report date and add wording such as <em>“Report dated March 15, 20X2, except for Note X, as to which the date is April 2, 20X2.”</em> Only the specific matter is covered by the later date.</li>
            <li><strong>Change the report date</strong> to the later date: extends responsibility for subsequent events through that later date.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Obtain updated written representations for the additional procedures and the later date covered.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>5) Subsequently Discovered Facts After Report Release</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss with management and TCWG whether the financial statements require <strong>revision</strong> and whether users are still relying on them.</li>
        <li>If revision is necessary and the client cooperates: advise management to <strong>make appropriate disclosures</strong>, revise the financial statements, and <strong>reissue</strong> the auditor’s report. Consider adding an <strong>emphasis‑of‑matter (EOM)</strong> or explanatory paragraph describing the revision.</li>
        <li>If the client <strong>refuses</strong> to act: take steps to <strong>prevent future reliance</strong> on the auditor’s report—seek legal advice, notify those charged with governance (TCWG), and consider notifying known users or regulators as permitted or required by law or regulation.</li>
        <li>For comparative periods, assess whether prior‑period opinions need updating or reissuance.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout danger"><strong>Red flag:</strong> Discovery of fraud or noncompliance affecting prior financial statements that were previously believed to be fairly presented.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>6) Documentation & Communication</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>Dates considered (financial statement date, auditor’s report date, report release date) and the procedures performed through those dates.</li>
        <li>Nature of each event/fact, evaluation (Type I vs Type II), and the basis for adjustments or disclosures.</li>
        <li>Copies of updated written representations, revised financial statements, and reissued reports; communications with management and TCWG.</li>
        <li>Legal counsel consultations and any actions taken to prevent reliance.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>7) Quick Checks</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ol>
        <li>Which events are adjusted? <strong>Type I — conditions existing at the balance‑sheet date.</strong></li>
        <li>What are your options if a fact arises before release? <strong>Dual‑date or change the report date.</strong></li>
        <li>What if facts arise after release and management won’t revise? <strong>Take steps to prevent future reliance and consider legal obligations.</strong></li>
        <li>Do you need new written representations when you dual‑date? <strong>Yes—covering the additional procedures and later date for that matter.</strong></li>
      </ol>
