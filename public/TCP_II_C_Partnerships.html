      <h2>Tricky‑area tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Debt relief</strong> upon contribution is a <em>deemed cash distribution</em> to the partner; add back the partner’s share of partnership debt to compute net relief.</li>
        <li>Outside basis includes <em>both</em> recourse and nonrecourse shares; <strong>at‑risk</strong> generally excludes nonrecourse (except qualified nonrecourse real estate).</li>
        <li>Cash distributions trigger gain only when they exceed outside basis; <strong>property distributions</strong> generally do not cause gain (watch hot assets/marketable securities).</li>
        <li><strong>§704(c)</strong>: first allocate built‑in gain/loss to the contributing partner; then split residual per agreement.</li>
        <li>Sale of an interest: include <strong>debt relief</strong> in amount realized and carve out <strong>hot assets</strong> as ordinary income.</li>
        <li>With a <strong>§754 election</strong>, only the transferee gets a special basis adjustment; it doesn’t change common inside basis.</li>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Illustrative Examples (computations)</h2>

      <h3>1) Formation with liability relief — computing initial outside basis</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Contribute property basis $60,000 (FMV $100,000) with $30,000 recourse debt; 50/50 partners.
Deemed cash distribution (debt relief) = $30,000 − $15,000 (partner’s share added back) = $15,000.
Initial outside basis = $60,000 − $30,000 + $15,000 = <strong>$45,000</strong> (no gain since deemed cash ≤ basis).</div>

      <h3>2) Basis rollforward during the year</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Begin $45,000
+ Ordinary income $40,000
− §1231 loss $10,000
− Cash distribution $20,000
+ Increase in liabilities $5,000
(Guaranteed payment received $12,000 — <em>does not</em> increase basis)
= Ending outside basis <strong>$60,000</strong>.</div>

      <h3>3) Cash distribution exceeding basis</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Outside basis $60,000; cash distribution $70,000 ⇒ Gain under §731 = $70,000 − $60,000 = <strong>$10,000</strong>; new basis = $0.</div>

      <h3>4) Property distribution (no gain)</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Outside basis $50,000; partnership distributes land (inside basis $30,000; FMV $80,000).
Partner’s basis in land = carryover (limited by outside) = <strong>$30,000</strong>.
New outside basis = $50,000 − $30,000 = <strong>$20,000</strong>.</div>

      <h3>5) §704(c) built‑in gain on sale</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Contributed asset basis $40,000 (FMV $100,000) sold for $120,000.
Total gain = $120,000 − $40,000 = $80,000.
Built‑in gain at contribution = $60,000 → allocate to contributor.
Residual $20,000 split 50/50 = <strong>$10,000</strong> each to both partners.</div>

      <h3>6) Guaranteed payment impact</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Ordinary income before GP $100,000; GP to Partner A $30,000; two equal partners.
Ordinary income after GP = $70,000 → A’s distributive share = <strong>$35,000</strong>.
A reports GP $30,000 separately; A’s basis increases by <strong>$35,000</strong> (not by the GP).</div>

      <h3>7) Sale of partnership interest with liabilities and hot assets</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Outside basis $60,000 (incl. $15,000 liabilities). Sells for cash $100,000; relieved of $15,000 debt.
Amount realized = $100,000 + $15,000 = $115,000 → Total gain = $115,000 − $60,000 = <strong>$55,000</strong>.
Of this, §751 hot assets = <strong>$20,000 ordinary</strong>; remainder <strong>$35,000 capital</strong>.</div>

      <h3>8) §754 / §743(b) step‑up</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Buyer pays $150,000 for interest when buyer’s share of inside basis is $100,000.
Special step‑up with §754 = $150,000 − $100,000 = <strong>$50,000</strong> allocated to underlying assets.</div>

      <h3>9) Disguised sale two‑year presumption</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Partner contributes property with basis $80,000; receives $190,000 within two years.
Treated as sale proceeds $190,000 with gain = <strong>$110,000</strong>.</div>

      <h3>10) §199A QBI from a partnership</h3>
      <div class="diagram">Ordinary business income before GP $200,000; GP to this partner $30,000; partner owns 50%.
QBI uses OBI <em>after</em> GP and excludes the GP received.
OBI after GP = $170,000 → QBI share = 50% × $170,000 = <strong>$85,000</strong>.</div>

      <div class="qa">
        <p><strong>1)</strong> Formation: Partner A contributes property (basis $60,000, FMV $100,000) with a recourse liability of $30,000 assumed by the partnership (two equal partners). A’s <em>recognized gain</em> and <em>initial outside basis</em>?</p>

        <details><summary>Answer &amp; Explanation</summary><p class="answer">A — §721 nonrecognition. Deemed cash distribution from debt relief = $30,000 − A’s share $15,000 = $15,000. Basis = $60,000 − $30,000 + $15,000 = $45,000. No gain because deemed cash ($15,000) ≤ basis.</p></details>
