          <li>Identify situations in which S status would be <strong>revoked or terminated</strong> and how to fix them.</li>
          <li>Calculate <strong>ordinary business income (loss)</strong> and <strong>separately stated items</strong> and understand per‑share, per‑day allocation.</li>
          <li>Compute and track the <strong>AAA</strong> and determine the <strong>tax treatment of distributions</strong> with and without accumulated E&amp;P.</li>
          <li>Compute a shareholder’s <strong>stock basis</strong> and <strong>debt basis</strong>, apply the <strong>basis → at‑risk → passive</strong> loss limits, and carryovers.</li>
          <li>Recognize corporate‑level taxes that can apply: <strong>built‑in gains (BIG) tax</strong>, <strong>passive investment income (PII) tax</strong>, and <strong>LIFO recapture</strong> on election.</li>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>1.</strong> Eligibility — single class of stock</summary>
          <p>Which of the following <em>would</em> create a prohibited second class of stock?</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>Voting and non‑voting common with identical liquidation rights.</li>
            <li>Different dividend rates based on shareholder group agreements.</li>
            <li>Restricted stock subject to forfeiture.</li>
            <li>Options/warrants outstanding.</li>
          </ol>
          <details><summary>Answer &amp; Rationale</summary>
            <p><strong>Answer: B.</strong> Different dividend preferences can violate the single‑class rule. Voting differences and reasonable buy‑sell restrictions typically don’t.</p>
          </details>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>2.</strong> Per‑share, per‑day allocation</summary>
          <p>S corp earns $365 ordinary income in a non‑leap year. On July 1, X sells half of her shares to Y. No interim book close is made. What amount is allocated to X?</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>$273</li>
            <li>$183</li>
            <li>$365</li>
            <li>$182.50</li>
          </ol>
          <details><summary>Answer &amp; Rationale</summary>
            <p><strong>Answer: A.</strong> X held 100% for 181 days and 50% for 184 days: 181/365 × 365 + 0.5 × 184/365 × 365 = 181 + 92 = <strong>273</strong>.</p>
          </details>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>3.</strong> Basis vs distributions</summary>
          <p>At Jan 1, T’s stock basis is $10. During the year, ordinary income is $5 and a distribution of $20 is made. No debt basis. Tax result?</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>$5 dividend; $5 capital gain</li>
            <li>$0 dividend; $5 capital gain</li>
            <li>$0 dividend; $10 capital gain</li>
            <li>$5 dividend; $10 capital gain</li>
          </ol>
          <details><summary>Answer &amp; Rationale</summary>
            <p><strong>Answer: B.</strong> Increase basis by income to $15, then reduce by distribution: basis goes to $0 and excess $5 is <strong>capital gain</strong>. S corp distributions generally aren’t dividends unless there is accumulated C E&amp;P.</p>
          </details>

          <summary><strong>4.</strong> Loss limitations ordering</summary>
          <p>Shareholder has $3,000 stock basis, $0 debt basis, is at‑risk for $2,000, and activity is passive. K‑1 loss is $4,000. How much is currently deductible?</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>$2,000</li>
            <li>$3,000</li>
            <li>$4,000</li>
            <li>$0</li>
          </ol>
          <details><summary>Answer &amp; Rationale</summary>
            <p><strong>Answer: A.</strong> Basis test allows up to $3,000, but the at‑risk test limits to <strong>$2,000</strong>. Passive rules may further suspend the $2,000 unless passive income exists.</p>
          </details>

          <summary><strong>5.</strong> BIG tax</summary>
          <p>A former C corp with built‑in gain at election sells appreciated assets in year 3 of S status. Which statement is correct?</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>No corporate‑level tax applies to built‑in gains after the first year.</li>
            <li>Corporate‑level tax may apply to net recognized BIG during the 5‑year recognition period.</li>
            <li>BIG tax applies only if the corporation also has passive investment income &gt;25% of gross receipts.</li>
            <li>BIG tax rate equals the shareholder’s top marginal rate.</li>
          </ol>
          <details><summary>Answer &amp; Rationale</summary>
            <p><strong>Answer: B.</strong> A corporate‑level BIG tax can apply during the 5‑year recognition period, using the corporate tax rate.</p>
